Here are some resources that we can look at if we are doing AR stuff - Dickson
https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/
- This link talks about doing augmented reality through the web
- This is done by using an HTML and javascript to code augmented reality through the phone
- The HTML script acts as a website to hold the augmented reality
- The javascript will be the augmented reality code
- The augmented can be shown on the phone by using a QR code
- Could be a good place to start when trying get some idea on how to do it
