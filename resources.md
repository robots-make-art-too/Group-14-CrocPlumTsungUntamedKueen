
## Technical Resources
- [FreeCodeCamp AR Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/augmented-reality/) - some ideas for projects/things we want to implement to our filter if we continue with that idea
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) - a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location-based AR and Marker tracking. We can take a look at some of this code to implement to our own program if we continue with the filter idea and want to implement it using javascript.
- How we can utilize [OpenCV  to perform real-time augmented reality in video streams](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/01/11/opencv-video-augmented-reality/). We can use some of this code/tutorial if we choose to implement our program in python
- [tracking.js](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/) - a javascript library which enables real-time colour tracking and face detection
- [Customizable AR face masks - Made with TensorFlow.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpiGFaHC_5U), the description of the video has the link to this project's github, it looks pretty interesting and related to our inital idea of making a filter

Here are some resources that we can look at if we are doing AR stuff - Dickson

https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/
- This link talks about doing augmented reality through the web
- This is done by using an HTML and javascript to code augmented reality through the phone
- The HTML script acts as a website to hold the augmented reality
- The javascript will be the augmented reality code
- The augmented can be shown on the phone by using a QR code
- Could be a good place to start when trying get some idea on how to do it

https://3sidedcube.com/ar-js-a-guide-to-developing-an-augmented-reality-web-app/#:~:text=it%20used%20for%3F-,AR.,create%20more%20innovative%20digital%20experiences.
- These two documents talk about ar.js
- Ar.js is the main javascript language used to code the ar reality 
- This is library containing stuff to make augmented reality through javascript
- Probably need node.js to make use of this
