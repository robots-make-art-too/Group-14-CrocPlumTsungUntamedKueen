## Technical Resources
- [FreeCodeCamp AR Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/augmented-reality/) - some ideas for projects/things we want to implement to our filter if we continue with that idea
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) - a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location-based AR and Marker tracking. We can take a look at some of this code to implement to our own program if we continue with the filter idea and want to implement it using javascript.
- How we can utilize [OpenCV  to perform real-time augmented reality in video streams](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/01/11/opencv-video-augmented-reality/). We can use some of this code/tutorial if we choose to implement our program in python
- [tracking.js](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/) - a javascript library which enables real-time colour tracking and face detection
- [Customizable AR face masks - Made with TensorFlow.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpiGFaHC_5U), the description of the video has the link to this project's github, it looks pretty interesting and related to our inital idea of making a filter
