##Some resources for project ideas/inspiration:
- [FreeCodeCamp AR Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/augmented-reality/)
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) - lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location-based AR and Marker tracking. We can take a look at some of this code to implement to our own program if we continue with the filter idea
