Hey here are some resources that we can use for the project - Dickson 

**Coding Resources for AR** 

https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/ - This link talks about doing augmented reality through the web. This is done by using an HTML and javascript to code augmented reality through the phone, the HTML script acts as a website to hold the augmented reality and the javascript will be the augmented reality code (The augmented can be shown on the phone by using a QR code). Could be a good place to start when trying get some idea on how to do it

https://3sidedcube.com/ar-js-a-guide-to-developing-an-augmented-reality-web-app/#:~:text=it%20used%20for%3F-,AR.,create%20more%20innovative%20digital%20experiences. - This link talks about ar.js is the main javascript language used to code the ar reality . This is library containing stuff to make augmented reality through javascript (Probably need node.js to make use of this)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIXJJoqM8BQ - Youtube tutorial on how to do augmented reality through the phone and use ar.js

https://github.com/AR-js-org - Github page of ar.js

**Idea Resources**

https://blog.lenslist.co/2021/06/21/10-ar-filters-creators-you-should-follow-june-2021/ - Examples of filters, probably too advance for us but should give some idea on what to see

https://www.bannerflow.com/blog/pokemon-go-augmented-reality-changing-marketing/#:~:text=The%20concept%20itself%20is%20simple,phone%20screen%2C%20and%20catch%20them. - Pokemon GO relating towards augmented reality

https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/ - Reddit page containing augmented reality stuff, could be a place to look for stuff relating to this project

## Technical Resources
- [FreeCodeCamp AR Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/augmented-reality/) - some ideas for projects/things we want to implement to our filter if we continue with that idea
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) - a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location-based AR and Marker tracking. We can take a look at some of this code to implement to our own program if we continue with the filter idea and want to implement it using javascript.
- How we can utilize [OpenCV  to perform real-time augmented reality in video streams](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/01/11/opencv-video-augmented-reality/). We can use some of this code/tutorial if we choose to implement our program in python
- [tracking.js](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/) - a javascript library which enables real-time colour tracking and face detection
- [Customizable AR face masks - Made with TensorFlow.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpiGFaHC_5U), the description of the video has the link to this project's github, it looks pretty interesting and related to our inital idea of making a filter

## Aesthetic Resources
- [Top 10 Best Augmented Reality Effects for Instagram App in 2021â€“2020, according to Catchar](https://medium.com/catchar/top-10-best-augmented-reality-effects-for-instagram-app-in-2020-according-to-catchar-89615f0b4d6f) - some examples of popular instagram filters from last year
- [ULTRA CLEAN Augmented Reality Experience BTS](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105069513/ULTRA-CLEAN-Augmented-Reality-Experience-BTS)
- [When Street Art meets Augmented Reality](https://haypopup.com/2015/09/03/when-street-art-meets-augmented-reality/)
- [some cool ar game filters on instagram that we can take inspiration from (since we're interested in making both a filter and a game of sorts)[https://tej.ie/10-instagram-ar-game-filters/]
- if we wanna go more the virtual pet-kinda route, the first thing that comes into mind are (nintendo ar cards)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxfs8vI-y_Q]
