# Phase 3
## Brief description 
Our AR scene shows the different stages of a Sunflower from it being planted in dirt to its final stage. The AR scene will show the stages of a flower seed being planted into dirt and being sprouted into a large flower. The goal when creating this project is to experiment with intractable augmented reality tools and also showcase the process of a seed growing into a flower. The stages being Dirt, Seed, Seed in Dirt, Sprouting and Adult Sunflower, each of the stages are. The AR can be interacted with using the keyboard and the mouse. Pressing the WASD keys can allow the camera to move around and clicking and dragging with the mouse can rotate the camera.
